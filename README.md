## Learning Roadmap

This roadmap defines the structured learning path of the Docker With Tutorials organization.

Instead of publishing isolated repositories without context, this roadmap organizes all content into progressive levels. Each level builds on the previous one, ensuring that foundational concepts are fully understood before moving to more advanced topics.

The objective is clarity and progression.

Every repository focuses on a single concept and is intentionally minimal. The roadmap connects them into a coherent journey.
As new repositories are created, they will be added to the appropriate level.

## Level 1 — Fundamentals

This level focuses on core Docker concepts. It establishes the mental model required to understand how containers work before introducing more advanced topics.

### Repositories

- **[docker-file-basics](https://github.com/docker-with-tutorials/docker-file-basics)**  
  Introduces the essential Dockerfile instructions (`FROM`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`) and explains how images are built layer by layer.

- **[docker-run-basics](https://github.com/docker-with-tutorials/docker-run-basics)**  
  Explains what happens when `docker run` is executed, how containers are created from images, and how the container lifecycle is tied to the main process (PID 1).
